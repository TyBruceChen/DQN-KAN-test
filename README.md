# DQN-KAN-test
This repository tries to realize DQN superseding MLP with KAN.

The code is originally run on Google Colab, if someone wants to run it locally in juypter, slight modifications (indentation) may be required. <br>
Besides, currently, this code failed to converge the DQN training, if someone is interested in successfully realizing the DQN-KAN training, please raise an issue.
